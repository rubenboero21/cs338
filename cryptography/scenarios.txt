1) Alice should use symmetric encryption (such as AES) to send her message to Bob.

2) Alice should use a digital signature. (cryptographic hash functions @ 10 mins) She should 
then concatenate her signature onto the end of her message, and send it to Bob. When Bob 
recieves the message, he can use Alice's public key and her signature to compute the the 
digest D'. If D' matches the output of hashing the message, then it's relatively 
safe for Bob to assume that Alice is the one who sent the message.

3) Alice and Bob can use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to exchange private keys. Then, 
Alice and Bob can use symmetric encryption to send their message.
