INTRO CRYPTOGRAPHY STUDY QUESTIONS

Among other online resources, you might find Chapter 5 of Anderson's Security Engineering, 2e helpful. By the middle of the fourth week of class, make sure you can answer the following questions clearly and concisely.

What's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms? Be able to name at least two examples of each.
	* Symmetric encryption algorithm
		The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.

		examples:
			Caesar cipher - moving letters down the alphabet by a set amt
			Stream ciphers
				RC4, AES-CTR, and more
			Block cipher
				Twofish, serpent, and more

	* Asymmetric encryption
		There are 2 keys, a secret key S and a public key P. There's 1 encryption function. S 		and P invert each other.

		

Of what does an RSA public key consist? Same question for the private key. What's the required mathematical relationship between the two?
	* Public key
		
	* Private key


Given an RSA public key, how do you encrypt a message? Given an RSA private key and a message encrypted with the corresponding public key, how do you obtain the original message?

What's a public key infrastructure (PKI), and why would you want one?
What is a cryptographic hash function, and what is one used for? What properties does it need to have? Be able to name at least two.

What is a digital signature? How could Alice use RSA and a hash function to compute a signature? How could Bob verify Alice's signature?

What is a message authentication code (MAC), and what is one used for? What properties does it need to have? Be able to name at least two.
