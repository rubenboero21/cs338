1) Alice should use symmetric encryption (such as AES) to send her message to Bob. They could 
use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DH) to agree on a secret key.

2) Alice and Bob should decide on a secret key k using DH. Alice should then come up with 
some message authentication code (MAC) C using k and the contents of her message to create a 
cryptographic hash. Alice should then concatenate her MAC to the end of her message and send
it to Bob using symmetric encryption. Once, Bob recieves the message, he can make sure that 
Mal has not tampered with the message by computing C' using k and the message he received. 
If C == C', then Bob can be relatively sure that the message has not been tampered with by Mal.

3) Alice and Bob should decide on a private key using DH. Then, Alice should create a digital 
signature (cryptographic hash functions @ 10 mins) and concatenate her signature onto the end 
of her message to Bob. When Bob recieves the message, he can use Alice's public key and her 
signature to compute the the digest D'. If D' matches the output of hashing the message, then 
it's relatively safe for Bob to assume that Alice is the one who sent the message.

4) 
* Alice could say that Bob used the wrong public key. (Bob did not in fact have Alice's public
    key.)  This is not likely because if the wrong public key was used then the D' that Bob 
    computes would probably not match D that Alice sent. 

* Alice could say that Bob used the wrong hash function to verify that the message is from 
    Alice. This is not likely because I would assume that they had decided on which hash 
    function to use prior to sending the message.

* Alice could say that there was an AITM attack. This is the most likely of the
    three options I give. If there was an AITM attack, then it's possible that Mal was able 
    to interrupt DH allowing Mal to decrypt/encrypt the message. Mal could then change the
    contract and send the message to Bob (without changing Alice's signature). If Bob doesn't
    check that the signature matches the message, then he would not be aware that Mal changed 
    the message.
