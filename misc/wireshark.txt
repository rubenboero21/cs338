2) 53408

3) The client needs a port so that the server can send information back to the client.

*I FEEL LIKE IM MISSING SOMETHING FOR THIS SECTION*
Daytime Protocol
    Type: Response
    Daytime: \n60199 23-09-12 19:25:31 50 0 0 735.7 UTC(NIST) * \n

* Response means that the server is sending back the requested information to the client.

* The Daytime information displays the date and time with some additional information such as whether daylight savings time is in effect. I found this information here:

6) [SYN] stands for synchronization. This means that the computer sending the SYN packet is giving the information necessary to establish communication with the computer receiving the SYN packet.

7) [ACK] stands for acknowledge. This means that a message has been received by the computer that sent the ACK packet.

8) [FIN] stands for finish. This means that the connection between server and client should be closed.

9) The nc client initiated the closing of the TCP connection. Frame 5 contains this frame summary: 

5	0.068152026	172.16.15.128	129.6.15.28	TCP	54	53408 → 13 [FIN, ACK] Seq=1 Ack=53 Win=64188 Len=0

Notably, I see "53408 → 13 [FIN, ACK]." I know that I'm asking port 13 on the server, so that must mean that 54408 is the port from which nc is asking the server for information. The arrow means that nc is sending a FIN packet to the server. Additionally, I used the ifconfig command to find out what my IP address is, and I see that the source of the FIN is from my IP address, so the nc client must have initiated the close.

===== HTTP =====

1) 2 TCP requests were opened. I can tell because there are 2 sets of SYN, SYN, ACK, ACK packets. Also, I can see that my IP address sent 2 distinct TCP packets to Jeff's website.

2) The homepage is requested on frame 7:
7	0.051142214	172.16.15.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	409	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 

I can tell that this is the correct frame because of the HTTP GET request for /index.html. Additionally, frame 7 tells me that the response to this request is in frame 9. In frame 9 I can see the html that was used to populate the website.

3) The client requests the photograph of Jeff's head is requested on frame 11:
11	0.188608490	172.16.15.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	378	GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1 

This frame shows the client initiating a GET request for a .jpg file (of Jeff).

===== QUESTIONS =====

* Did you find a way to fix the visual bug in the raw bytes section of the Wireshark output?
