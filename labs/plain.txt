This is plain text. I sure hope no one reads it...

Notes:
* On Mac (rather than Kali), need to add the -i tag to specify that cipher.base64 is the input:

	base64 -d -i cipher.base64 | hexdump -C

* Instead of typing in the k and iv, you can use bash stuff to read it in from a text file
	openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -K $(cat k.txt) -iv $(cat iv.txt) -base64 -in cipher.base64 -out 	decrypted.txt
